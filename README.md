#Argushiigi

An ontology for Traveller information.

Named after Argushiigi Admegulasha Bilanidin, or "Vilani Repository of All Knowledge".

Argushiigi is a collection of ontologies and conventions designed to allow software to readily exchange data about Traveller worlds, campaigns, games, etc. It is not a program itself but a set of machine-readable descriptions of Traveller data.
