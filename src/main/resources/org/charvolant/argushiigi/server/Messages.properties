  Argushiigi is a test-bed for a <a href="http://www.farfuture.net/">Traveller<sup>5</sup></a> ontology and resource server. \
  The <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-features/">ontology</a> describes how pieces of information in a role-playing game fit together (characters, players, characteristics, skills, etc.). \
  The resource server allows information to be stored online and retrieved, along with relationships to other information. \
  This web-site allows you browse some sample resources and the ontology itself. \
